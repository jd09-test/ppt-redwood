# Template-based PowerPoint Generator

An Automated PowerPoint Generator Based on the Oracle Redwood Template

There are already many AI-powered tools in the market that generate PowerPoint presentations (e.g., Gamma, Beautiful.ai). These are excellent platforms that produce beautiful and dynamic slides.

However, the styles of their presentations are typically generated by AI, which makes it difficult to strictly follow predefined formatting. They usually generate a web page first and then convert it to a PPT file. Despite their powerful features, these tools face several limitations:

- **Inconsistent formatting**: Original formatting is often lost during conversion.
- **Style inconsistency**: It's difficult to enforce corporate branding standards.
- **Template limitations**: No fine-grained control over the position and style of individual elements.
- **Poor editability**: The generated PPTs are not easy to modify afterward.

This project solves these problems by **strictly adhering to a predefined template**, ensuring:

- ✅ **Brand Consistency**: Fully based on Oracle Redwood PPT templates to maintain visual standards
- ✅ **Format Standardization**: Uses predefined layouts and placeholders to guarantee uniform formatting
- ✅ **Automated Generation**: Uses the MCP protocol to let AI generate PPT content without worrying about formatting

## Features

- 🎯 **Template-driven**: Generates slides strictly based on Oracle Redwood PPT templates
- 📐 **Layout System**: Supports multiple predefined slide layout templates
- 🎨 **Rich Text Rendering**: Supports formatted text (bold, italic, underline, color, hyperlink)
- 🌓 **Theme Switching**: Supports light/dark themes
- 🤖 **AI-Friendly**: Exposes an MCP-compliant API for AI integration

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Python and `uv` must be installed ([MCP Docs: Setting up your environment](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client#setting-up-your-environment))
- `Coursor` must be installed. Other AI agents might work but haven't been tested ([Coursor Installation Guide](https://docs.cursor.com/en/get-started/installation))
- Download the project code and store it in a suitable location

### Configure MCP Server in Coursor

**Note:** `WORK_DIR` is required. It specifies Coursor's working directory, where all generated files are saved.

- `directory`: Directory where the project code resides
- `WORK_DIR`: Path to Coursor's working directory

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ppt-generator": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory",
        "D:/MCP/templated-ppt-generator-mcp-server",
        "run",
        "src/server.py"
      ],
      "env": {"WORK_DIR": "D:/MCP/playground"}
    }
  }
}
```

### Generate PPT with MCP Server

Simply enter your requirements in Coursor. The MCP server will generate a PPT file accordingly.

**Best Practices**

- Make sure your requirements are clear, specific, and complete
- Provide appropriate input to help the AI understand the context
- Always double-check the generated PPT as AI can still make hallucination mistakes

### Manual Mode (No Agent Required)

Automated execution relies heavily on the capabilities of the AI agent, and not all agents can properly understand our needs.

Therefore, I designed a manual mode (I actually prefer to manually perform multiple steps; it's more reliable).

- **Action 1**: Generates prompt text. You can then use any AI you like to generate JSON content. You will need to save the generated content as a JSON file.
- **Action 2**: Generates a presentation from the generated JSON file. You will be prompted to enter the path to the `.json` file and then a `.pptx` file will be generated.

Execute the following script to execute manual mode.
```sh
uv run src/manual_run.py
```



### Limitations

- **Template Dependency**: Requires the Oracle PPT template file and a manually created description file. The template must be placed in the `assets` directory.
- **Layout Constraints**: Only supports predefined layouts, cannot dynamically create new ones
- **Placeholder Constraints**: Only supports predefined placeholder types and positions
- **Style Limitations**: Only basic styles supported (bold, italic, underline, color, hyperlink). No complex CSS styles
- **Multimodal Support**: Currently supports text only. Images, charts, etc., are not supported yet
- **AI Agent Compatibility**: Only tested on Coursor. Other agents might work if they support local file I/O, but this hasn't been verified

```

### Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core development language
- **uv**: Dependency management
- **FastMCP**: MCP server framework
- **python-pptx**: PowerPoint file handling

### MCP Server Architecture

The MCP server is built using the FastMCP framework and exposes the following tools:

- `get_presentation_rules`: Retrieves slide generation rules
  - Provides PPT generation rules including data format, style, and layout descriptions
  - Returns predefined layout metadata in JSON format

- `generate_presentation`: Generates a PowerPoint file from JSON input
  - Parses JSON content, including layout and slide content
  - Matches JSON layout to slide templates
  - Applies styles and fills placeholders
  - Outputs a `.pptx` file

### AI Workflow

1. **Understand Requirements**: AI receives prompt and background context
2. **Fetch Presentation Rules**: Calls `get_presentation_rules` to understand format and layout
3. **Generate JSON**: AI creates structured JSON with layout and styled content
4. **Render PPT File**: Calls `generate_presentation` to produce the final `.pptx` output

### Template System

This project uses Oracle Redwood PPT templates. Required files must be in the `assets` directory:

- `Oracle_PPT-template_FY26_blank.pptx`: The base template used to create new slides and extract layout info
- `layouts_template.yaml`: Human-written layout descriptions used to guide AI prompt generation
- `prompt_template.txt`: Prompt template containing instructions for generating AI content
